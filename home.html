			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm Megan Lau from San Jose, California. <br/> I study mechanical engineering at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. <br/> I spend my time in school doing electric race car chassis design and manufacturing in FSAE Electric. On top of tutoring people in math and engineering-related classes, I work as a research assistant at <a href="http://www.deboer-lab.engineer/">DeBoer Lab</a> to understand how to better support under-resourced students through engineering education. <br/> During my spare time, I enjoy capturing moments with my DSLR camera, and playing with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I also love challenging myself at <a href="https://devpost.com/moylau27">hackathons</a> with not just sleep deprivation, but also coding to make physical creations come to life! </p>

					<h3>CATIA V5 Surface Modeling</h3>
					<div class="description">
						<h4>Audi R8</h4>
						<p>As a first surface modeling project, I decided to challenge myself with CADing the body of a car.  I focused on learning to make surfaces with freestyle curves based on existing drawings.<br/>After finding the blueprints of the Audi R8, I used the Sketch Tracer workbench to import, position, and scale the four views (front, back, top, side) to a common axis.  I used the 3D curve tool inside the Freestyle workbench to draw individual paths for half of the car, then adjusted the cartesian coordinates and imposed tangency for each point. I moved on to filling the paths in Generative Shape Design, and finally mirroring the surfaces to create the entire vehicle.</p>

						<h4>Canon T2i Digital Camera</h4>
						<p>Unlike the Audi R8, I used this exercise to further develop surface modeling skills while practicing 3D modeling real-life objects without blueprints or drawings.<br/>Measuring my own camera with calipers, I translated dimensions of five different parts of the camera into a surface model. Inside generative shape design, I first modeled the lens by creating cylinders and using the circular pattern to rotate small square ridges that represent the rubber grip used to adjust focal length of the lens. Next, I used curves in both the frontal and profile planes to create both the sun shield and lens cover. With both generative shape design and freestyle workbenches, I drew paths and moved individual points to create a rough model of the camera body. The last component is the knob used to switch between different camera modes (e.g. portait, automatic). Similar to the grip on the lens, I rotated small ridges on a conical frustrum to complete the CAD exercise.</p>

					<h3>Autonomous Suitcase</h3>
					<p>My friends and I decided we wanted our carry-on luggages to follow us around the airport so we could have a hands-free journey sometime in the near future. We thought of problems like how to support the luggage, move the entire apparatus, and have the frame follow its user. Taking observations from people play games with Xbox Kinect and prior experience with brushless skateboard motors, we split tasks amongst each other. As two people CAD-ed and laser cut the luggage frame using MDF boards, I worked with another friend to write the necessary program in Python which would allow the system to move. We utilized ROS python packages to control the skateboard wheels and speed controllers. Then, we integrated Kinect's existing motion tracking code such that the wheels would move forward and turn in the same direction as the person being tracked by the Kinect. Thus, code + MDF luggage frame = Autonomous Suitcase! </p>

					<h3>Natural Telepresence</h3>
					<p>Inspired by our passion for robots, interests in virtual reality, and motivation to do well at our first hackathon, together my friends and I created... Natural Telepresence. This small cardboard robot can be driven around with controls on a web app and features a camera mounted on a gimbal. When looking through a Google Cardboard, the user can see a live-stream video from the robot's perspective. <br/> Personally, it was my first experience with coding. As a complete novice in programming, using ROS (put a link/reference for "ROS") python packages proved to be a more difficult challenge; however, I eventually learned to use it for </p>
