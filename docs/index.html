					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I'm Megan Lau from San Jose, California. <br/> I study mechanical engineering at 
					Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. <br/> I spend my time in school doing 
					race car chassis design and manufacturing in FSAE Electric. On top of tutoring 
					people in math and engineering-related classes, I work as a research assistant at 
					<a href="http://www.deboer-lab.engineer/" target="_blank">DeBoer Lab</a> to understand how to better 
					support under-resourced students through engineering education. <br/> During my spare 
					time, I enjoy capturing moments with my DSLR camera, and playing with Adobe Photoshop 
					and Illustrator. I also love challenging myself at <a href="https://devpost.com/moylau27" target="_blank">hackathons</a> 
					with not just sleep deprivation, but also coding to make physical creations come to life! </p>

								<h4>Overview</h4>
								<img src="./images/2017_PDAssist/apparatus.png" class="col-sm-4" style="float: right;" />
								<p>In a sophomore mechanical engineering design course (<a href="#courses" style="color: salmon;" data-dismiss="modal">ME 263</a>), the class was tasked to conduct market research, search for relevant patents, design, CAD, and build a prototype of any assistive device. My team decided to address the need for hand-operated vehicles used by those whom experience difficulties with leg movements and paraplegics, or individuals paralyzed from the waist down. Due to limited leg movement, these people cannot operate a vehicle on their own and must use a device that can control both foot pedals while steering the wheel. </p>
								<p>While looking through current products on the U.S. market, we found quite a few problems with the existing benchmarks. Many of the hand-controlled designs were ineffective, fragile, difficult to install, and intrusive to non-handicapped drivers (device may cover or replace the typical steering wheel and foot pedals). Also, though products like electronic hand control systems function well and have good customer reviews, they are not affordable solutions. We combined these with findings from interviews with members of our target audience to create a list of requirements for our product.</p>
								<p>Aiming to design a system that avoids issues with current products while keeping human-centered design considerations in mind, we wanted to ensure that the final product is ergonomic / comfortable, safe to use, not obstructive to any driver, and inexpensive. At the end of the semester, our team (Team DREAM) eventually created “DREAM Driving” so people who cannot operate the foot pedals in a car may drive whenever and wherever they want.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h4>How It Works</h4>
								<p>This driver assistive device has intuitive hand controls, such that the user need only push the entire handle to control the brake pedal and pull on the lever to accelerate. While the user steers with one hand, the other is placed on the hand controls, which consists of a typical bicycle grip and bike brake lever secured to one end of an L-shaped tube. This tube is attached to a single-plane pivot that is mounted on the vehicle’s dashboard. Starting from within the L-shaped tube, two bowden cables run along the kick panel and run behind the car pedals with 3D-printed attachments. When force is applied to the hand controls, the cables pull on their respective pedals back towards the front of the vehicle.</p>

								<h4>Audi R8</h4>
								<p>As a first surface modeling project, I decided to challenge myself with CADing 
								the body of a car.  I focused on learning to make surfaces with freestyle curves 
								based on existing drawings.<br/>After finding the blueprints of the Audi R8, I 
								used the Sketch Tracer workbench to import, position, and scale the four views 
								(front, back, top, side) to a common axis.  Afterwards I used the 3D curve tool inside the 
								Freestyle workbench to draw individual paths for half of the car, then adjusted 
								the cartesian coordinates and imposed tangency for each point. Finally, I moved on to 
								filling the paths in Generative Shape Design, and finally mirroring the surfaces 
								to create the entire vehicle.</p>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h4>Canon T2i Digital Camera</h4>
								<p>Unlike the Audi R8, I used this exercise to further develop surface modeling 
								skills while practicing 3D modeling real-life objects without blueprints or drawings.
								<br/>Measuring my own camera with calipers, I translated dimensions of five different 
								parts of the camera into a surface model. Inside generative shape design, I first 
								modeled the lens by creating cylinders and using the circular pattern to rotate 
								small square ridges that represent the rubber grip used to adjust focal length of 
								the lens. Next, I used curves in both the frontal and profile planes to create both 
								the sun shield and lens cover. With both generative shape design and freestyle workbenches, 
								I drew paths and moved individual points to create a rough model of the camera body. T
								he last component is the knob used to switch between different camera modes (e.g. 
								portait, automatic). Similar to the grip on the lens, I rotated small ridges on a conical 
								frustrum to complete the CAD exercise.</p>

							<img src="./images/autonsuitcase.jpg" />
							<p>My friends and I decided we wanted our carry-on luggages to follow us around the 
							airport so we could have a hands-free journey sometime in the near future. We thought 
							of problems like how to support the luggage, move the entire apparatus, and have the 
							frame follow its user. <br/> With an Xbox Kinect 
							and prior experience with brushless skateboard motors, we split tasks amongst each 
							other. As two people CAD-ed and laser cut the luggage frame using MDF boards, I worked 
							with another friend to write the necessary program in Python which would allow the 
							system to move. We utilized ROS python packages to control the skateboard wheels and 
							speed controllers. Then, integrated Kinect's existing motion tracking code such 
							that the wheels would move forward and turn in the same direction as the person being 
							tracked by the Kinect. Thus, code + MDF luggage frame = Autonomous Suitcase! </p>

						<div class="modal-body">
							<p>Inspired by our passion for robots, interests in virtual reality, and motivation 
							to do well at our first hackathon, together my friends and I created... Natural 
							Telepresence. This small cardboard robot can be driven around with controls on a web 
							app and features a camera mounted on a gimbal. When looking through a Google Cardboard, 
							the user can view a live-stream video from the robot's perspective.</p>
							<p>Personally, this was a first and favorite hackathon experience not only because I helped build 
							a robot with pieces of cardboard, but my friends introduced me to the world of programming. 
							As a complete novice in coding, learning to use <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/">ROS</a> 
							python packages proved to be the more difficult challenge. But eventually, I learned to use 
							it to pass the smartphone's gyroscope data to the controller for the gimbal, which 
							allowed the robot's camera to turn the same way as the user's head. Our greatest 
							challenge was avoiding gimbal lock and we had overcome this by converting the phone's Euler 
							angles to quaternions.<br/></p>
