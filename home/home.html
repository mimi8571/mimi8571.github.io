					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I'm Megan Lau from San Jose, California. <br/> I study mechanical engineering at 
					Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. <br/> I spend my time in school doing 
					electric race car chassis design and manufacturing in FSAE Electric. On top of tutoring 
					people in math and engineering-related classes, I work as a research assistant at 
					<a href="http://www.deboer-lab.engineer/" target="_blank">DeBoer Lab</a> to understand how to better 
					support under-resourced students through engineering education. <br/> During my spare 
					time, I enjoy capturing moments with my DSLR camera, and playing with Adobe Photoshop 
					and Illustrator. I also love challenging myself at <a href="https://devpost.com/moylau27" target="_blank">hackathons</a> 
					with not just sleep deprivation, but also coding to make physical creations come to life! </p>

					<h3>Paraplegic Drive Assist</h3>
					<p>In a sophomore mechanical engineering design course (<a href="#courses">ME 263</a>), the class was tasked to design any assistive device. My team decided to create a device so that paraplegic people and anyone who experiences difficulties with leg movements could drive a car with their hands. <br/> </p>

					<h3>CATIA V5 Surface Modeling</h3>
					<div>
						<h4>Audi R8</h4>
						<p>As a first surface modeling project, I decided to challenge myself with CADing 
						the body of a car.  I focused on learning to make surfaces with freestyle curves 
						based on existing drawings.<br/>After finding the blueprints of the Audi R8, I 
						used the Sketch Tracer workbench to import, position, and scale the four views 
						(front, back, top, side) to a common axis.  I used the 3D curve tool inside the 
						Freestyle workbench to draw individual paths for half of the car, then adjusted 
						the cartesian coordinates and imposed tangency for each point. I moved on to 
						filling the paths in Generative Shape Design, and finally mirroring the surfaces 
						to create the entire vehicle.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="">
						<h4>Canon T2i Digital Camera</h4>
						<p>Unlike the Audi R8, I used this exercise to further develop surface modeling 
						skills while practicing 3D modeling real-life objects without blueprints or drawings.
						<br/>Measuring my own camera with calipers, I translated dimensions of five different 
						parts of the camera into a surface model. Inside generative shape design, I first 
						modeled the lens by creating cylinders and using the circular pattern to rotate 
						small square ridges that represent the rubber grip used to adjust focal length of 
						the lens. Next, I used curves in both the frontal and profile planes to create both 
						the sun shield and lens cover. With both generative shape design and freestyle workbenches, 
						I drew paths and moved individual points to create a rough model of the camera body. T
						he last component is the knob used to switch between different camera modes (e.g. 
						portait, automatic). Similar to the grip on the lens, I rotated small ridges on a conical 
						frustrum to complete the CAD exercise.</p>

					<h3>Autonomous Suitcase</h3>
					<p>My friends and I decided we wanted our carry-on luggages to follow us around the 
					airport so we could have a hands-free journey sometime in the near future. We thought 
					of problems like how to support the luggage, move the entire apparatus, and have the 
					frame follow its user. Taking observations from people play games with Xbox Kinect 
					and prior experience with brushless skateboard motors, we split tasks amongst each 
					other. As two people CAD-ed and laser cut the luggage frame using MDF boards, I worked 
					with another friend to write the necessary program in Python which would allow the 
					system to move. We utilized ROS python packages to control the skateboard wheels and 
					speed controllers. Then, we integrated Kinect's existing motion tracking code such 
					that the wheels would move forward and turn in the same direction as the person being 
					tracked by the Kinect. Thus, code + MDF luggage frame = Autonomous Suitcase! </p>

					<h3>Natural Telepresence</h3>
					<p>Inspired by our passion for robots, interests in virtual reality, and motivation 
					to do well at our first hackathon, together my friends and I created... Natural 
					Telepresence. This small cardboard robot can be driven around with controls on a web 
					app and features a camera mounted on a gimbal. When looking through a Google Cardboard, 
					the user can view a live-stream video from the robot's perspective. <br/> Personally, 
					this was a first and favorite hackathon experience not only because I helped build a robot 
					with pieces of cardboard, but my friends introduced me to the world of programming. 
					As a complete novice in coding, learning to use <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/">ROS</a> 
					python packages proved to be the more difficult challenge. But eventually, I learned to use 
					it to pass the smartphone's gyroscope data to the controller for the gimbal, which 
					allowed the robot's camera to turn the same way as the user's head. Our greatest 
					challenge was avoiding gimbal lock and we had overcome this by converting the phone's Euler 
					angles to quaternions.<br/></p>
